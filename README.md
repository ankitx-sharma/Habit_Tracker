# HabitTracker
A Python-based web application designed to help users create, track, and maintain daily habits.
The project is built with Flask and Jinja2 on the backend, features a clean HTML/CSS frontend, and uses MongoDB for persistent data storage.

Users can add new habits, update their daily progress, and visualize how consistently they maintain their routines — making habit-building simple, structured, and motivating.

## Purpose
I developed this project to strengthen my application development skills and deepen my understanding of Python-based APIs and web technologies. As a software developer, I wanted to explore practical backend–frontend integration while refining my overall development workflow. I hope this project not only showcases my work but also inspires you to explore, learn, and build something of your own.
